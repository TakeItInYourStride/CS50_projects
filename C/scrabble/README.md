A game of scrabble that uses a 'get_string' function to receive a custom input and calculate a score based on the value of a char.

Points Array:
int POINTS[] = {1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 8, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 4, 10};

I learned about:
* Malloc
* Arrays
* Prototype / Helper Functions

Personal Reflection:
* Revisiting a problem after a week is too long. Great for revision but the time to revisit issues means re-visiting the issues at a slower pace.

Next time:
* Use // TODO:'s
* Complete the simple function of the program before increasing complexity. The refining process will be a lot simpler and cohesive.
* Follow the strict instructions of the task. Try not to deviate too much.
* Use the debugging tool more; less reliance on ChatGPT.

_scrabble.c_

Working and submitted version.

_scrabblerefined.c_

Is a version that verifies a users input; instead of accepting symbols or numbers, these are declined and an error message is shown. Additionally, character are converted from _isupper_ to all lower. This was to initially simplify the process of conversion. (Not Check50 compliant).

_scrabblehard.c_
More complicated vers (but incomplete):
