Readability is program that grades the users inputted text based on the number of letters, words, and sentences using
the Coleman-Liau index:
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8

where L is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text, and S is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.

New concepts learnt / practiced:

- Type casting for the purpose of avoiding trunctating, particularly when working with decimals and need to round().
- Cleaner code; the use of functions to clearly define the use of each section of code.
- Continued use of Arrays to reiterate through a string.

Difficulties:

- Refining code to the functions after completing draft in main.

To improve:

- Planning and design the program before working on the main. By clearly defining the functions it will create a more structured workflow.
